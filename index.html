  <body> <h1>My name is Samantha Whitney</h1> 
    <p>I am a data science and programming student. I enjoying taking things apart and putting them back together in order to see how they work. My favorite thing to do when I have free time is read books and watch Marvel movies. Although Marvel movies unfortunately seem to be on a decline as far as quality is concerned.</p>
